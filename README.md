[![version](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/persephonep.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/persephonep/)



PersephoneP is a web browser written by Python3 and [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/).
This browser is based on Chromium,
 which is an open source web browser engine included in PyQt6.
The data from web pages gotten by Chromium is drawn on PyQt Widgets.
PyQt is one of the most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform C++ framework.
Utilizing the characteristics of Qt as cross-platform framework,
 PersephoneP is able to run on multi-platform if python is installed.

## The reasons of Development

Some people say that making browser is reinventing the wheel,
 however, there are two reasons.

1. Understanding the way to get data from web page and to draw it on our PC.
1. Some workers are forced to use the IE at work. BUT,
 we wanna use other than IE!!

### History of Development

1. I got a job with a japanese company.
1. This company prohibited my using browsers except IE.
1. I decided to develop my browser.
1. That company forced me to submit applications before installing software or libraries which I want.
1. PyQt6 based on only sip module and sip run with PurePython.
1. I decided to use PyQt6.
